# Flood Prediction Model using Logistic Regression

This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a flood will occur based on meteorological data. The steps involve data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Data:**
   The dataset `kerala.csv` is loaded using `pandas`.

   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv("kerala.csv")
